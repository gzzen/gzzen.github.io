  <p>
    I'm an undergraduate student in <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">UBC</a>. I'm studying Computer Science (BCS) as my second degree. 
    I finished my first degree in Bachelor of Science (BSc) by May 2023, with combined major in Mathematics and Economics.

    I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, at which people view <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangsheng_(Daoism)">Yang-sheng</a> (the state of physical well-being) more important than anything else. 
    At the age of 17, I came to Winnipeg and had a good taste of the winter that lasts for 6 months. 
		I'm currently living in Vancouver.
